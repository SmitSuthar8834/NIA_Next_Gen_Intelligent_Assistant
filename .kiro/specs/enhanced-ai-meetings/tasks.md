## Task 1 Completion Summary

### âœ… What was completed in Task 1 (Foundation Setup):

**Database Schema Enhancement:**
- âœ… Created `scheduled_meetings` table with timezone support and meeting room management
- âœ… Added `question_sets` and `questions` tables for customizable question management
- âœ… Implemented `meeting_participants` table for multi-user tracking
- âœ… Created `email_notifications` table for tracking sent emails
- âœ… Added `conversation_events`, `meeting_analyses`, and `meeting_recordings` tables
- âœ… Updated existing `ai_meetings` table to support scheduled meetings
- âœ… Created comprehensive database indexes for optimal query performance
- âœ… Added Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all new tables
- âœ… Implemented database triggers for automatic updates and data integrity

**Enhanced Backend Models:**

### ðŸŽ¯ What you need to do next:

**For Task 2 (Backend Services & APIs):**
1. **Email Service Implementation** - Create SMTP service with calendar attachments
2. **Meeting Scheduler API** - Build CRUD operations for scheduled meetings
3. **Question Management API** - Create endpoints for question sets and questions
4. **Integration** - Connect new services with existing Gemini AI and Supabase

**Key files to work with:**
- `backend/app/services/` - Create new email and scheduler services
- `backend/app/routers/` - Add new API endpoints
- `backend/app/core/config.py` - Add email configuration
- Extend existing `ai_meetings.py` router with scheduling functionality

The foundation is now solid and ready for building the backend services on top of it!
