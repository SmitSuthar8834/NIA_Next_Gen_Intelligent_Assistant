## 🔧 Issues Found and Fixed

### **Critical Fixes Applied**

#### 1. **Missing Enum Values** - FIXED ✅
**Issue**: `ConversationState` enum was incomplete
```python
# BEFORE (incomplete)
class ConversationState(str, Enum):
    WAITING = "waiting"

# AFTER (complete)
class ConversationState(str, Enum):
    WAITING = "waiting"
    ACTIVE = "active"
    AI_SPEAKING = "ai_speaking"
    USER_SPEAKING = "user_speaking"
    WAITING_FOR_RESPONSE = "waiting_for_response"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
```

#### 2. **Missing Database Function** - FIXED ✅
**Issue**: `_save_conversation_message` function was referenced but not defined
```python
# ADDED
async def _save_conversation_message(room_id: str, user_id: str, message: dict):
    """Save conversation message to database"""
    try:
        meeting_response = supabase.table("scheduled_meetings").select("id").eq("meeting_room_id", room_id).execute()
        if meeting_response.data:
            meeting_id = meeting_response.data[0]["id"]
            supabase.table("conversation_events").insert({
                "meeting_id": meeting_id,
                "speaker_type": "human",
                "speaker_id": user_id,
                "message_text": message.get("message", ""),
                "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
            }).execute()
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to save conversation message: {e}")
```

#### 3. **Missing Router Registrations** - FIXED ✅
**Issue**: Question sets and real-time analysis routers not registered
```python
# ADDED to main.py
app.include_router(question_sets.router)
app.include_router(real_time_analysis.router)
```

#### 4. **Missing Service Methods** - FIXED ✅
**Issue**: Several service methods were referenced but not implemented

**Added to QuestionService**:
```python
async def get_question_set(self, question_set_id: str, user_id: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Get a specific question set"""
```

**Added to MeetingSchedulerService**:
```python
async def join_meeting_as_ai(self, meeting_id: str) -> bool:
    """Mark AI as joined to the meeting"""

async def get_upcoming_meetings(self, user_id: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[ScheduledMeeting]:
    """Get upcoming meetings for a user"""

async def get_meetings_by_date_range(self, user_id: str, start_date: datetime, end_date: datetime, status_filter: Optional[MeetingStatus] = None) -> List[ScheduledMeeting]:
    """Get meetings within a date range"""
```

### **Integration Fixes Applied**

#### 5. **Lead Linking in Meeting Creation** - FIXED ✅
**Issue**: New leads created during meeting scheduling weren't properly linked
- Enhanced `MeetingScheduler` component with new lead creation form
- Added proper lead validation and creation flow
- Ensured meeting-lead relationship is established correctly

#### 6. **WebSocket Authentication** - FIXED ✅
**Issue**: WebSocket connections getting 403 Forbidden errors
- Fixed WebSocket URL from `/ws/meeting/` to `/ws/signaling/`
- Added proper token validation in WebSocket endpoint
- Implemented authentication middleware for WebSocket connections

#### 7. **AI Message Processing** - FIXED ✅
**Issue**: AI wasn't processing human messages in real-time
- Added conversation message handling in signaling
- Integrated AI orchestrator with WebSocket message flow
- Implemented proper message routing to AI services
